# STM32F4xx HAL Driver

## Overview
This repository contains the STM32F4xx Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) module driver. The HAL provides a set of generic and common APIs that can be used by peripheral drivers and user applications to start using the STM32F4xx microcontroller.

The HAL driver includes functionalities for initializing the system, managing peripherals, handling low-level hardware initialization, time base configuration, and providing essential control functions for STM32F4xx-based applications.

## Features
- Initialization and de-initialization of the HAL library.
- Configuration of time base using SysTick.
- Support for various HAL control functions like `HAL_GetTick`, `HAL_Delay`, and more.
- Device revision and unique ID retrieval.
- Debug module control during various low-power modes.
- Flash memory management, including bank swapping support for specific STM32F4xx models.

## Versioning
**STM32F4xx HAL Driver Version:** 1.8.3

| Field             | Value  |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Main Version**  | 0x01   |
| **Sub1 Version**  | 0x08   |
| **Sub2 Version**  | 0x03   |
| **Release Type**  | RC (Release Candidate) |

## How to Use This Driver

### Initialization
To use the HAL driver, the `HAL_Init` function must be called first. This will:
- Configure the Flash prefetch, instruction, and data caches.
- Set the NVIC priority grouping.
- Configure the SysTick timer to generate a 1ms time base interrupt.
- Call the `HAL_MspInit` callback for low-level hardware initialization.

#### Example:
```c
#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"

int main(void)
{
    // Initialize HAL library
    HAL_Init();

    // Your application code here

    while (1)
    {
        // Main loop
    }
}

**## Tick Configuration**
The HAL driver provides an API to configure the time base used by the `HAL_Delay` function. By default, SysTick is used, but you can configure it for other time sources if needed.

To configure the tick frequency, you can use:

```c
HAL_SetTickFreq(HAL_TICK_FREQ_1KHZ); // Set tick frequency to 1kHz
